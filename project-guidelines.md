## 1. Project Structure

Maintaining a consistent project structure helps organize code and assets efficiently. Follow these guidelines when structuring your projects:

- **Root Directory:** Place project-specific files (e.g., README.md, license) in the root directory.
- **Source Code:** Organize source code into a clear directory structure (e.g., `main.rs, handlers/, db/`).
- **Documentation:** If you will have documentation - include it in a `docs/` directory for project documentation.

## 2. Version Control

Effective version control is crucial for collaboration and tracking changes. Follow these version control guidelines:

- **Branching:** Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Pull Requests:** Create pull requests for code review before merging into the master branch.
- **Version Tags:** Tag releases with version numbers for easy reference.

## 3. Collaboration

Collaboration is key to successful project development. Follow these collaboration guidelines:

- **Communication:** Use project communication channels for discussions.
- **Issues:** Create and track tasks using GitHub Issues.
- **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews for each pull request.
- **Meetings:** Schedule regular team meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks.
