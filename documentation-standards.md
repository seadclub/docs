# Software Engineering and Development Club Documentation Standards

Welcome to the Software Engineering and Development Club's documentation standards! This document outlines guidelines on how to document code, projects, and processes effectively. Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for the understanding and future maintenance of our projects.

## Table of Contents

1. [Code Documentation](#code-documentation)
2. [Project Documentation](#project-documentation)
3. [Process Documentation](#process-documentation)

## 1. Code Documentation

In [code-conventions.md](code-conventions.md), we have established code conventions. Additionally, code documentation should adhere to the following standards:

- **Comments:** Use comments sparingly and aim for self-explanatory code. Only include comments for complex algorithms or to clarify non-obvious code sections.
- **Inline Documentation:** Use inline documentation tools if applicable (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript).

## 2. Project Documentation

Proper project documentation is essential for onboarding and maintaining projects. Follow these standards:

- **README.md:** Each project MUST have a comprehensive README.md covering project overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
- **Wiki:** Consider using the repository's wiki for in-depth documentation, guides, and tutorials.
- **Architecture Diagrams:** If applicable, include high-level architecture diagrams to aid understanding.
